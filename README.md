# Painting Pairing -- Memory Game 
### browser-based card matching 

"Memory Game" is my extracurricular project chosen for the requirement of Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree Program, with the stated purpose of demonstrating my mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

The objective is to match all the randomly scattered duplicates of eight famous paintings hidden behind a 4 x 4 empty gallery. 

The player selects two blank squares for an attempted match: if there is a match the paintings remain displayed, otherwise they return hidden at the same location.  If all eight pairs of paintings are matched, a beautifully framed congratulations is presented showing the player's game time and his rating (designed to always be less than the top 3 star rating).

### TODO
Increase Udacity's unreasonable rating criteria of 10-moves/2-stars to 12 moves, and 14-moves/1-star to 16 moves. 

## Features

Restart game: restart button provided to reset at any time a new randomly distribued gallery, the timer and move counter. 

Moves: live update of number of moves

Matches: live update of matches

Rating: live update of 3 star rating

Timer:  game time in seconds is displayed upon winning.
